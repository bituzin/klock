# PULSE - Social Ritual dApp

PULSE is a decentralized application (dApp) that gamifies daily on-chain interactions through a quest-based system. Users complete daily rituals, maintain streaks, earn points, and level up their profiles. The application supports multiple blockchain networks including Base (Ethereum L2) and Stacks (Bitcoin L2).

## Smart Contracts

### Solidity Contract (Base/Ethereum)

The Solidity contract is deployed on Base (Ethereum L2) and implements:

- ReentrancyGuard for protection against reentrancy attacks
- Pausable functionality for emergency stops
- Ownable access control for admin functions
- Gas-optimized bitmap storage for quest tracking

**Technology Stack:**
- Solidity 0.8.20
- OpenZeppelin Contracts 5.0
- Hardhat for development and deployment

### Clarity Contract (Stacks)

The Clarity contract is deployed on Stacks and uses Clarity version 4 with epoch 3.3:

- No loops by design (prevents DoS attacks)
- Principal-based access control
- Block-height based time tracking
- Atomic transaction guarantees

**Technology Stack:**
- Clarity 4
- Clarinet 3.12.0 for development
- Stacks epoch 3.3

## Quest System

PULSE features 10 unique daily quests, each with different point values:

| ID | Quest Name | Points | Description |
|----|------------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Daily Check-In | 50 | Secure your streak and get Pulse Points |
| 2 | Relay Signal | 100 | Pass the torch to another timezone |
| 3 | Update Atmosphere | 30 | Sync local weather to chain |
| 4 | Nudge Friend | 40 | Ping a friend to save their streak |
| 5 | Mint Hour Badge | 60 | Collect unique hour stamps |
| 6 | Commit Message | 20 | Etch your mood on the ticker |
| 7 | Stake for Streak | 200 | High risk, high reward (future feature) |
| 8 | Claim Milestone | 500 | Evolve your profile level |
| 9 | Predict Pulse | 80 | Vote on tomorrow's activity |
| 10 | Open Capsule | 1000 | Reveal long-term rewards |

### Daily Combo

Complete quests 1 (Daily Check-In), 3 (Update Atmosphere), and 6 (Commit Message) within 5 hours to activate the Daily Triple Combo for 200 bonus points.

---

## Streak and Points System

### Streak Mechanics

- Streaks increment with consecutive daily check-ins
- A 2-day grace period prevents accidental streak loss
- Streaks reset to 1 if the grace period is exceeded

### Point Multipliers

| Streak Length | Multiplier |
|---------------|------------|
| Days 1-7 | 1x |
| Days 8-30 | 2x |
| Days 31+ | 3x |

### Level Progression

Levels are calculated based on total accumulated points:
- Level = (Total Points / 1000) + 1

---

## Development

### Frontend Development

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Type checking
npm run type-check
```

### Smart Contract Development

#### Solidity (Base)

```bash
cd contracts/solidity

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network baseSepolia

# Deploy to mainnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network base
```

#### Clarity (Stacks)

```bash
cd contracts/clarity

# Check contract syntax
clarinet check

# Run in console
clarinet console

# Deploy to testnet
clarinet deployments generate --testnet --low-cost
clarinet deployments apply --testnet

# Deploy to mainnet
clarinet deployments generate --mainnet --low-cost
clarinet deployments apply --mainnet
```

---

## Deployment

### Frontend Deployment

The frontend is configured for deployment on Vercel:

```bash
# Build production bundle
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel deploy --prod
```

### Contract Deployment

See the Development section for contract deployment commands. Ensure you have:

1. Sufficient native tokens for gas fees
2. Private keys or mnemonics configured in environment
3. RPC endpoints configured for target networks

---

## Security

### Smart Contract Security Measures

**Solidity Contract:**
- OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard prevents reentrancy attacks
- Pausable contract allows emergency stops
- Access control restricts admin functions
- No unbounded loops or arrays
- Input validation on all public functions
- Solidity 0.8+ built-in overflow protection

**Clarity Contract:**
- No loops by design (language constraint)
- Principal-based authentication
- Block-height for immutable time tracking
- No external calls that could re-enter
- Static analysis prevents recursive patterns

### Frontend Security

- No private keys stored in frontend
- Wallet connection via secure WalletConnect protocol
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Protected routes require authentication

### Best Practices

- Never commit private keys or seed phrases
- Use separate wallets for testnet and mainnet
- Verify contract addresses before interacting
- Review transaction details before signing

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID | Reown (WalletConnect) Project ID | Yes |
| PRIVATE_KEY | Deployer private key (for contracts) | For deployment |
| BASESCAN_API_KEY | Basescan API key for verification | Optional |
